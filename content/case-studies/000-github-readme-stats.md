title: Github Readme Stats
excerpt:
  Github Readme Stats dynamically generates stats for github user's readmes,
  After github launched it's profile readme feature I thought I would do
  something unique and dynamic with new readme resumes so I made
  github-readme-stats which is now used by many people and got over 1k stars on
  github within 7 days, and currently it has over 10k stars. it has few cool
  features including `Github Extra Pins` which allows us to pin more that 6
  repos in our profile.

info:
  idea:
    The main idea of github-readme-stats is to serve github user's stats
    dynamically with the help of github api and rendered with svgs.
  tech: [Github API, Vercel, Serverless]

Hey guys! i hope you are doing well.

Yesterday after seeing that lot of people on twitter are creating their Github
profile Readmes i thought i should do something cool & unique, so i created this
->

### Github Readme Stats

Github readme stats allows you to simply add a markdown image link and it will
show you realtime stats for your github account.

And the cool thing is since it's just an image you can embed it anywhere even on
any websites!
